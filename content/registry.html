  <p>
  We’ve been fortunate to benefit in both love and in life.</br>
  We also recognize that gift-giving causes people strife.</br>
  </br>
  If choosing a gift is not your cup of tea,</br>
  You might find ideas at our Amazon Registry (linked)</br>
  </br>
  In lieu of traditional gifts, and we mean this with sincerity,</br>
  We’d also be honored if you donated to a charity.</br>
  </br>
  We’ve listed a few here that we like to support</br>
  </br>
  Your presence at our wedding is the greatest gift of all.</br>
  We can’t wait to see you! We’re sure it will be a ball!</br>
  </p>
